# Online Mastermind: Game Rules

## Objective
The goal of **Online Mastermind** is to crack the secret code generated by the system within a limited number of attempts using logic and deduction.

## Game Setup
- The code is randomly generated by the system.
- The player selects the number of pegs (4â€“7) and whether colors can repeat.
- A digital notepad is available for jotting down thoughts and patterns.

## Gameplay
1. **Make a Guess:** Select a sequence of pegs in the available slots.
2. **Receive Feedback:** The system provides clues:
   - **Black peg** = A correct color in the correct position.
   - **White peg** = A correct color in the wrong position.
   - **No peg** = That color is not in the code.
3. **Use Notes:** Write down observations, patterns, or strategies to track progress.
4. **Winning & Losing:**
   - **You win** if you guess the exact combination within the allowed attempts.
   - **You lose** if you fail to guess the code before running out of turns.
